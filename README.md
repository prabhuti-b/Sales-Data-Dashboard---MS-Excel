# Sales-Data-Dashboard---MS-Excel
This is a sales dashboard, which is created using analysis from pivot tables. On the basis of the pivot tables, pivot charts are created. 
The dashboard can be filtered by three variables: year, month, region.
Emphasis has been given on presenting unambiguous and lucid charts, that convey meaningful and useful insights. This has been done by taking into account appropriate units of
measurements, appropriate baselines and sorting.
